<h3>Description</h3>

<p>New England clam chowder is defined as "a thick chowder made from clams, potatoes, onions, sometimes salt pork, and milk or cream." The recipe usually calls for heavy cream, light cream, or whole milk as the base for the soup. This addition of milk or cream — producing the soup's unmistakable white color — is the biggest difference between the New England style and all the rest. This version is also often thickened with oyster crackers and doesn't include any vegetables except potatoes. </p>

<h4>Ingrediants</h4>

<ul>
    <li>3 (6.5 ounce) cans minced clams</li>
    <li>1 cup minced onion</li>
    <li>1 cup diced celery</li> 
    <li>2 cups cubed potatoes</li>
    <li>1 cup diced carrots</li>
    <li>3/4 cup butter</li>
    <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li> 
    <li>1 quart half-and-half cream</li>
    <li>2 tablesoons red wine vinegar</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
   <li>Drain juice from clams into a large skillet over the onions, celery, potatoes and carrots. Add water to cover, and cook over medium heat until tender.</li> 
   <li>Meanwhile, in a large, heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour until smooth. Whisk in cream and stir constantly until thick and smooth. Stir in vegetables and clam juice. Heat through, but do not boil.</li>
   <li>Stir in clams just before serving. If they cook too much they get tough. When clams are heated through, stir in vinegar, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
</ol>
